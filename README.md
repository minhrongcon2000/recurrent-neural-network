# Recurrent Neural Network In Binary Addition
## Overview
This project uses recurrent neural network (RNN) in predicting the sum of two binary number with given number of bits.

## Dependencies
* numpy
* matplotlib
Use [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) to install any missing dependencies

## Basic Usage
Just run demo.py, that's all. If you want to understand more about the code, I have a Jupyter notebook to explain all the stuff
